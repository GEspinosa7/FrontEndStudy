# Front End Study

A simple Front End project I am creating based on the HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript lessons of the [CursoEmVideo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/course/curso-de-html5/) course.

This project is used by the teacher to teach didactically.


A website with information about Google Glass was created, showing its software and hardware specifications.
